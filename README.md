Collabco Platform - Challenge Branch
=================

The Collabco platform is a Drupal Content Management System (CMS) used to facilitate communication and sharing of ideas within networks or organisations. It was created by Collabforge as part of a project with the Australian Government to develop an innovation platform for Australian industry networks. The platform was built in collaboration with Meta and Food Innovation Australia Limited, organisations also funded by the Australian Government at the time of Collabco’s development. It is an implementation of Collabforge's ongoing research into collaboration an innovation practice. As such, the software is constantly adapted and improved through ongoing partnerships with similar orientations.
